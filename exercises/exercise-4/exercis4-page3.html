<h2>Introduction to Variants:</h2>
<p> While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games. Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Omaha Hold'em: Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form their hand.</li>
    <li> Seven Card Stud: Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card dealt.</li>
    <li>Five Card Draw: Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.</li>
    <li>Razz: A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.</li>
    <li>Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple: Variants of Hold'em where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card must be discarded after the flop.</li>
    <li>Stud High-Low: A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and psychology that offers endless excitement and opportunities for improvement.
